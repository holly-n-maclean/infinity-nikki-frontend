        Hi! I'm Luna â€” a longtime fan of the Nikki game series and fashion-focused games. This blog is my creative space where I post outfit ideas, game commentary, and inspiration from the Nikki universe. Whether you're here for styling tips, image collections, or just some cozy vibes, I'm glad you're visiting.

      <p style={{ lineHeight: '1.7', fontSize: '1.05rem', color: '#555', marginTop: '1rem' }}>
        I built this blog myself using React and Node.js as a passion project, and I'm continuing to improve it over time. Thanks for stopping by ðŸ’–
